DevOps (short for Development and Operations) is a set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that aims to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The main goal of DevOps is to shorten the development lifecycle, increase the frequency of software releases, and improve the quality and reliability of software products. It is often used in the context of continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and automation.
